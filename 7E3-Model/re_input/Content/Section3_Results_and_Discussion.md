The PBPK model for 7E3 was evaluated with plasma and tissue PK data in wild-type and FcRn knockout mice. 

These PK data have been used together with PK data from 5 other compounds to simultaneously identify  parameters during the development of the generic model for proteins and large molecules in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)).

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct-profiles).
