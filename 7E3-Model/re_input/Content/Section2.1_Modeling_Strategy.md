The development of the large molecule PBPK model in PK-Sim® has previously been described by Niederalt et al. ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)). In short, the model was built as an extension of the PK-Sim® model for small molecules incorporating (i) the two-pore formalism for drug extravasation from blood plasma to interstitial space, (ii) lymph flow, (iii) endosomal clearance and (iv) protection from endosomal clearance by neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) mediated recycling. 

For model development and evaluation, PK data were used from compounds with a wide range of solute radii and from different species. The PK data used for parameter estimation were from the following compounds:  antibody–drug conjugate BAY 79-4620 in mice (Bayer in house data),  antibody 7E3 in wild-type and FcRn knockout mice  ([Garg 2007](#5-references), [Garg2009](#5-references)), domain antibody dAb2 in mice ([Sepp 2015](#5-references)), antibodies MEDI-524 and MEDI-524-YTE in monkeys ([Dall'Acqua 2006](#5-references)), and antibody CDA1 in humans ([Taylor 2008](#5-references)). The PK data used for model evaluation were from inulin in rats  ([Tsuji1983](#5-references)) and tefibazumab in humans ([Reilly 2005](#5-references)).  

The PBPK model including the estimated physiological parameters as described by Niederalt et al. ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)) is available in the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite from version 7.1 onwards.

This evolution report focuses on the PBPK model for the antibody 7E3. 

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and PK) can be found in  [Section 2.2](#22-data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in  [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions).
