# 7E3-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of the antibody 7E3 in mice [1].

## Repository files
This repository contains:

- a [PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/importing-exporting-project-data-models#exporting-project-to-snapshot-loading-project-from-snapshot) of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/7E3-Model/releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases).**
