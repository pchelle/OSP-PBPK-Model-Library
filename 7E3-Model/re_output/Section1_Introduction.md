7E3 is a murine IgG1 antibody directed against human platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. 

For 7E3, plasma and tissue concentration-time profiles for various tissues were measured in wild-type as well as FcRn knockout mice ([Garg2007, Garg2009](#5-references)). These data were used together with pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 5 other compounds to identify unknown parameters during the development of the generic large molecule physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)). 

The herein presented evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for 7E3 in wild-type and FcRn knockout mice for the PK data used for the development of the generic large molecule model in PK-Sim.  

The presented 7E3 PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/7E3-Model).
