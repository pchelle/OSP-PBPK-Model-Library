The herein presented PBPK model overall adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of  BAY 79-4620 in mice. The tissue concentrations from the low dose tissue dissection study (dose approximately 0.025 mg/kg) are similarly well described as the tissue concentrations from the autoradiography study (dose 1.25 mg/kg), with the exception of the late concentrations at 168 h after administration from the tissue dissection study which are underestimated by the model.  The largest deviations between measured and simulated concentration-time profiles are observed for spleen concentrations which are overestimated by the model and brain concentrations which are underestimated.

The PK data had been used during the development of the generic large molecule PBPK model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)) together with PK data from 5 other compounds (7E3, CDA1, dAb2, MEDI-524 & MEDI-524-YTE).
