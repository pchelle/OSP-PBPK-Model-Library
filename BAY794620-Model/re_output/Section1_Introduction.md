BAY 79-4620 is an antibodyâ€“drug conjugate consisting of a human IgG1 mAb directed against human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) conjugated to the toxophore monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline based linker ([Petrul 2012](#5-references)).

For BAY 79-4620, tissue concentration-time profiles for a large number of different mice tissues were measured and used together with pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 5 other compounds to identify unknown parameters during the development of the generic large molecule physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)). 

The herein presented evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for BAY 79-4620 in xenograft mice for the PK data used for the development of the generic large molecule model in PK-Sim. A standard PK-Sim model was used without an additional tumor organ and without target mediated drug disposition effects from CA IX binding in the tumor - in contrast to the model which has been used in Ref. ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)). 

The presented BAY 79-4620 PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/BAY794620-Model).
