The PBPK model for BAY 79-4620 was evaluated with blood and tissue PK data from mice.

These PK data have been used together with PK data from 5 other compounds to simultaneously identify parameters during the development of the generic model for proteins and large molecules in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)).

The fitted dissociation constant for binding to FcRn in the endosomal space is rather high compared to usual dissociation constants. This might reflect a lowered affinity to FcRn due to the conjugation of the toxophore or alternatively is a surrogate for a clearance process not represented in the model.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
