### In vitro / physico-chemical Data <a id="invitro-and-physico-chemical-data"></a>

A literature search was performed to collect available information on physicochemical properties of BAY 79-4620. The obtained information from literature is summarized in the table below. 

| **Parameter** | **Unit** | **Value** | Source                       | **Description**                                              |

### PK Data <a id="PK-data"></a>

The biodistribution data from mice for BAY 79-4620 were Bayer AG in house data taken from two studies:

| Data                        | Description                                                  |

| Whole-body autoradiography  | Female nude mice (NMRI nu/nu), bearing HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenografts, were dosed intravenously with 1.25 mg/kg body weight of 125I-labeled BAY 79-4620. The distribution of total radioactivity in organs and tissues was determined by quantitative whole-body autoradiography after sacrificing the mice (two per time) at various time points after administration. |
| Wet-tissue dissection study | Female nude mice (NMRI nu/nu), bearing HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenografts, were dosed intravenously with 2 µCi (approx. 500 ng) of 125I-labeled BAY 79-4620. The distribution of total radioactivity in organs and tissues was determined after sacrificing the mice (three per time) and dissection of the organs at various time points after administration by determination of radioactivity using a gamma-counter. The concentrations were reported as percentage of dose / g tissue. These values were converted to concentrations in ng/ml assuming a density of 1 g/ml for all tissues except for bone for which a density of 1.5 g/ml was assumed (as in Ref. [Baxter 1994](#5-references)). |
